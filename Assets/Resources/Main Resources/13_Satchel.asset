  Description: 'The Satchel Charge is a midgame raiding tool that can be used to
    destroy player-made buildings for the purpose of entering and looting another
    player''s base.

    The Satchel charge becomes armed when placed, has a random
    time until detonation, and has a small chance to malfunction, requiring the user
    to pick up and rearm the Charge. Note that sometimes the charge will re-ignite
    when the dud is picked up, going off with a very short fuse!'
